### Tic Tac Toe - tech test practice

Introduction
-----

Whilst at Makers we had a tech test week with various tests to try.  One of these tests was tic tac toe, but on the day this had been scheduled I was with my colleagues planning our final projects.  Therefore, now I have graduated I have made the decision to go back and do this tech test as practice and preparation.
