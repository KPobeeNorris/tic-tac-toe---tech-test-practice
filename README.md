Tic Tac Toe - tech test practice
-----

###Introduction

Whilst at Makers we had a tech test week with various tests to try.  One of these tests was tic tac toe, but on the day this had been scheduled I was with my colleagues planning our final projects.  Therefore, now I have graduated I have made the decision to go back and do this tech test as practice and preparation.  

###The Brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

* There are two players in the game (X and O)
* Players take turns until the game is over
* A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
* A turn ends when a player claims a field
* A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
* A game is over if a player wins
* A game is over when all fields are taken

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

###Installation

* Git clone https://github.com/KPobeeNorris/tic-tac-toe---tech-test-practice.git
* cd tic-tac-toe---tech-test-practice
* bundle install

###Tests

* type 'rspec' at the command line, and whilst at the top of the project directory.
